### Precision, logic and computational thinking
- Common English = vague 
	- programming uses one word per item no synonyms, no pronouns
	- if else statements allow for clarifying beyond the usual 
	- Attention to detail is a benefit of learning programming
### Programming is different
- Combination of concepts and skill 
- "Skills" not as common in other academic subjects
- Mistakes happen
### White space and precise formatting
- Most coding require a program's output match the expected out put including whitespace 
	- This can be important for the sake of compiling or also for the sake of readability
### Programming is all about precision
- Some examples
	- use of i vs j can make things hard to track down in the future
	- using int when char was needed
	- not considering n could be 0 in sum/n
	- the difference between x/2 vs x/2.0 
	- Counting form i being 0 to i < 10 vs i <= 10 
- These differences provoke a need to pay attention to every minute detail 
- White space helps to cultivate this precision 


### Python Arithmetic
- + = addition
- - = subtraction
- \* = multiplication
- / = division (float) => returns float (always) (less accurate for larger numbers)
- // = division (floor) => Rounds down the result of division to the nearest number (This operand always returns the same type if there is a float in use than it will return a float if not it will return an int)
- % = Modulus => remainder
- \** = power returns the first number raised to the second 
	- This also works with negative powers aswell
#### Precedence
\+ -
\* / // 
**
Order in increasing importance going downwards

### Associativity
- This is the method by which the order of operation is determined between two operators that have equal precedence
- Brackets nullify precedence and Associativity
