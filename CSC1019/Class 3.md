## Generating a random number
- This is for some programs that need random num
	- Ex: A game needs a dice roll
- RandomNumber() is a built-in for Coral that takes 2 args lowValue and highValue nad returns a random integer in the rand lowValue to highValue
### Pseudo-random
- integers generated by RandomNumber() are known as pseudo-random
- random number is automatically seeded by coral based on current time 
- As a result you can choose your seed by using the function SeedRandomNumbers()
- Seeding should only be done once per program before the RandomNumber() call

### Integer division 
##### Division: Integer rounding 
- when the operands of / are both ints, the operator preforms int division, which doesn't generate a fraction. (remainders are thrown out)
- The / operator performs floating-point division if at least one operand is a floating-point type
-  you can never use 0 for the second operand of / or % because divide by zero is mathematically undefined
	- This results in a divide by 0 error causing the program to terminate
### Type conversions
#### Type conversions 
- A calculation sometimes has to mix integer and floating point numbers. 
- #typeconversion is a conversion of one data type to another, such as an integer to a float.
	- automatic conversion is known as #implicitConversion 
	- Ex in Coral:
		- Arithmetic operators like + and \* if either operand is a float the other is automatically converted into a float => then a floating-point operation is performed
		- For assignments, the right side is to left side type 
#### Type casting
- A programmer sometimes needs to explicitly convert an item's type
	- Ex: A program needs a floating-point result from dividing two integers, then at least one of the ints needs to be converted to a float
- A #typeCast converts a value of one type to another type
- This can be done by multiplying an int by 1.0 
#### Common Errors
- Accidentally perform integer division when floating point division was intended
- Cast the entire result of int division rather than the operands thus not obtaining the entire floating point 
## Modulo operator
- Evaluates remainder of the division of two integer operands
- **Modulo doesn't work with floats**
## Data types
- Should choose the best match for the value being held or represented

| Data type  | Description                                    | Example                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #Integer   | is a whole number                              | 1, 999, 0, -25                                               |
| #float     | Floating-point number that is real             | 98.6, 0.0001, -666.67                                        |
| #character | A character is a single letter or symbol       | 'A', 'p' '@'                                                 |
| #string    | Sequence of characters                         | 'Hello', 'The forecast for today is sunny with highs of 75F' |
| #Boolean   | something that has only 2 values true or false | 'Door is open'                                               |
| #array     | ordered list of items of a given data type     | array of ints, or array of floats                            |
## Constants
- a #constant is a named value that holds a value that cannot change.
- used in programs to hold the value of mathematical or physical constants
	- Ex:
		- Pi
		- Speed of light
- constants can also be used to represent any number that doesn't change during the execution of the program
- *Good practice is to minimize the use of literal numbers in code by using constants to improve code readability*
