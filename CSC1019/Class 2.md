## Computer program basics
- What does a program consist of?
	- A program consists of instructions executing one at a time
	- Basic instruction types are:
		- #input: A program gets data from file, keyboard, other input source
		- #process: program performs computation on the data (think like addition)
		- #output: A program puts the data somewhere file, screen, network, etc.
	- #variables are used to refer to data because data can change
	- programs are like recipes because they contain instructions that the computer executes
## Computational Thinking
- A sequence of instructions that solves a problem is an #algorithm
- common way to become familiar with #algorithm is turtle graphics
	- instruct a robotic turtle to walk certain path
	- break down via instructions
		- Ex: Turn left, walk forward 10 steps

## First program
- #flowchart is a graphical language for creating or viewing computer programs
- #program is a list of statements
- #statements carry out an action

## Basic Input
- programs get input => perform some processing => output values are put on screen
- inputs are gotten from keyboard, file or fields from a webform and on an on
- a parallelogram represents an output statement
- #stringLiteral consists of text within double quotes this text can contain any combination of characters or spaces 
- #character includes any letter, digit or symbol
- #cursor indicates where the next output item will be placed in the output
- #newline is a special two character sequence \n whose appearance is an output string literal causes the cursor to move the next output line

## #Comment and #whitespace
- #comment is for humans to better understand code but is ignored by the program
- #whitespace refers to blank spaces between items within a statement and and to newlines mainly considered in the context of readability
	- whitespace cannot be used within variable names nor can the digits of a number
- #common_Practice is to use exactly one space before and after each operator

## #code and #pseudocode
- #pseudocode is text that resembles a program but is simplified to make it easier to understand

## Programming languages vs. problem solving
- Large part of programming is problem solving 
	- Creating a mehodical solution to a given task

# Programming languages Low or High?
- there are a few different types
- High 
- Low
- High level languages are closer to natural language
- low level are closer to machine code  => greater control over hardware but harder to write and understand

| High Level                                  | Low level                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| simpler to write and faster                 | closer to machine code                                                     |
| easier to  find and fix mistakes            | greater control over hardware                                              |
| closer to natural language                  | harder to write and understand                                             |
| Can work on a variety of different machines | Not easily dadpted                                                         |
| Contains ready made features<br>            | mostly used for specific tasks needing high performance or precise control |
|                                             | require assemblers for running instructions                                |
|                                             | debugging is difficult                                                     |
## What makes Python high level
- Python has an extensive standard library
- Automated Memory Management
- Platform independence => can be run on practically any system

## Software vs Hardware
- Firmware is software that users don't interact with
