One Thing that I like:
Karina I believe commented on my assignment last week, on using functions to make the program more reusable. After taking a look at the assignment I decided to go down this functional route. While I have some experience in JS with functions, it was fun to try them out in python. (Python feels a lot more straightforward while JS can sometimes feel finicky).
One Thing that I will improve with time:
Giving myself more time. While I am happy with the result there were some things that I couldn't address such as; input type errors, due to time restraints, due to me starting late on the assignment. I would also like to know how to generate tests for python, for more efficient testing.
