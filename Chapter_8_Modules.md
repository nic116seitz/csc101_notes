# Module Basics
## **Modules**
- Code that runs one line at a time is generally used when writing code for short programs, (for practicing syntax)
- Programmers typically write Python program code in a file called a #script
- The script is then passed into a python interpreter
- Collections of logically related code can be stored in separate files and imported for use into a script that requires said code
- Modules are made available for use via an import statement
- Once imported any object defined in that module can be accessed using #dot_notation
	- Ex: A variable `speed_of_light` defined in `universe.py` is accessed via `universe.speed_of_light`
- Separating code into different modules makes management of larger programs simpler
- Python standard library is a collection of pre-installed modules.
